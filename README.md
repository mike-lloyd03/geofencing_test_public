# geofencing_test

This is a simple program to test creating and monitoring geofences on your phone. Geofence coordinates are hard coded in `lib/geofences.dart`. Update them accordingly.

Whenever you enter or exit a geofence, a record should be added to the local database and they can be viewed on the `Events` screen in the app. Logs are available on the `Logs` screen and you can see which geofences have been configured in the `Geofences` screen.
